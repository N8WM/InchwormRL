## Setup

Follow these instructions to set up the codebase locally.

### 1. Clone the Repo
Run your favorite version of the git clone command on this repo. One version:

`git clone git@github.com:gwholland3/InchwormRL.git`

### 2. Install Python
This code was developed and run on Python `3.10.10`, but most likely any version of Python `3.10` will do. Make sure you have an appropriate version installed locally.

### 3. Install Requirements
We recommend doing this in a fresh Python virtual environment. Cd into the repo and run:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Interacting With the Project
Our whole project has a single entry point, `run_environment.py`. You can control the functionality via command-line arguments to Python script.

`python3 run_environment.py`
